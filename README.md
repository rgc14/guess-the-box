# 4X4-game
This is a minsweeper like game, there is a by 4 by 4 grid like this:

01 | 02 | 03 | 04
-----------------
05 | 06 | 07 | 08
-----------------
9 | 10 | 11 | 12
-----------------
13 | 14 | 15 | 15
-----------------
the computer chooses one of the boxes and you have to guess it, if you guess it you win, if you choose a neighbouring one (including diagonals), you are still in the game, if you choose a box that does not border it you lose
I am planning on creating a gui and eventually also making it detect invalid inputs but I will do the gui first
